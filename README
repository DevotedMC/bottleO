bottleO is an old project.

It allows a user to walk up to an enchanting table, smack it with glass bottles in hand, and transfer XP stored on the player, into experience bottles.

Additionally, it adds a recipe allowing bottled experience to be turned into emerald blocks.

We need the following immediate changes:

1. Update to spigot-1.8.8

2. Remove the emerald recipe.

3. Set a lower baseline of xp conversion. Only half of the xp in a player's inventory should be stored.

We need the following optional and desired changes:

1. Recognize a custom enchantment table with lore. (Made in recipemanager)

2. Allow these custom enchantment tables to change the xp conversion baseline at that station.

3. Allow an incremental, exponentially decreasing addition of xp conversion based on amount of bottles bottled at the station.

4. Store that baseline increment in lore.

5. Allow the mining, and theft, of enchantement table with lore and baseline xp intact (subtracting let's say 1% to discourage movement of the table).
